Rohit & Liu: go through the code (github) and try to understand

Garance & Rohit: try to run code and improve , make it work 

-> 1st version of code that is working 


Liu : search for papers about breathing patterns / exercises, their effect on brain activity. 
read & take notes
-> come up with a variety of suggestions for breathing patterns 

Tasks above due for Tuesday 08th October ! __________________________________________________

Future improvements (coding) : 


1) Optimizing LED lighting and performance
In suggested_BP(), the lighting of individual pixels happens sequentially with sleep() calls. 
This might lead to performance lag or undesired effects if the time intervals are too small.
Consider separating the LED matrix updates from user input to ensure smoother operation,
possibly by using asynchronous functions (though the Sense HAT API does not natively support
async). For example, the matrix update could happen in a separate thread, allowing more
efficient and non-blocking execution.


2) Breathing pattern flexibility 
Add more suggestions of BP in step_2()


3) To discuss : Saving data ?
Maybe log the user's breathing patterns and reaction times to a file for further analysis or for 
providing feedback on their performance over multiple sessions.

4) User feedback : 
Providing additional real-time feedback to the user during the reaction time game or breathing 
exercise. For example, you could update the LED matrix to reflect progress, such as displaying
a different color as the user gets closer to completing the breathing pattern or reacting more
quickly.

5) Considering edge cases 
Handle edge cases such as if the user doesnâ€™t press anything or presses incorrect buttons during 
the reaction time game. Also, ensure that None values in deduce_breathing_pattern or
measure_simple_reaction_time are dealt with more robustly.
